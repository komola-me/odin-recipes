    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants. After being boiled, the rectangular lasagna noodles are drained and placed in layers with a filling that varies based on different local traditions. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The industrially prepared lasagna can keep for about two weeks if tightly sealed and kept refrigerated. The handmade type should be eaten within two days. If already cooked and stuffed, the lasagna noodles can stay in the refrigerator for 3-4 days. To keep them longer, they can be frozen either with or without pre-cooking them. When frozen, they keep up to one month.
