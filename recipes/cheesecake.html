    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>
        This creamy, fluffy cheesecake recipe is perfectly sweet with a light and delicate texture, all wrapped in a crunchy Graham cracker and toasted pecan crust. Getting the perfect no crack bake is easier than you think and the end result is so beautiful it almost doesn't need any topping!

        I love cheesecake but not those dense bricks you find at some restaurants, for me a cheesecake should have a light fluffy texture and a nice balance of sweet and tangy. The crust has to have a nice crunch and depth of flavor so I add toasted pecans into the mix and it makes all the difference! A cracked cheesecake is still delicious but I have all my baking tips below for all of you that want a beautiful unblemished surface.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 1/2 pounds cream cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1 3/4 cups sugar</li>
        <li> 2 tsp vanilla extract </li>
        <li> 5 eggs </li>
        <li>3/4 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>16 Graham Cracker</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Graham crackers, toasted pecans, salt, sugar and cinnamon to a food processor fitted with a blade attachment. Pulse until broken into a fine meal.</li>
        <li>Drizzle the melted butter in while pulsing. Remove blade and use a spatula to finish mixing in the butter.</li>
        <li>Transfer the crust to the spring form pan. Use a tall glass to tamp it down and to the side. The more you compact the crust the better it will cut after baking so give it a nice press. Bake at 350F for about 10 minutes or until it just begins to brown.</li>
        <li>Cream the room temperature cream cheese, sugar and salt together until smooth. Iâ€™m using a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment but this can be done with a hand mixer as well.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle in the flour while the mixer is running on low. Scrape down the bowl really well and then miix until batter is totally smooth.</li>
    </ol>
